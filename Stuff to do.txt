I am creating an application that will make quizzes and tests from a random bank of questions. 
I plan to have 2 types of users an admin user and a regular user. 
The admin user will have the capabilities to create quizzes and test and assigning them to the users,
create questions, create users, and see the grading per regular user. 
The regular user will be able to take pre-created tests and quizzes or create a quiz for the selected book and chapters.
