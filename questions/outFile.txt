The vapor density of propane is 1.52.
The vapor density of carbon monoxide is 0.96. Carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air
which will give it a tendency to rise in a very still ambient airflow.
383) You are called to a home where there is a smell of gas inside the residence. After
speaking to the home owner he tells you that his gas grill propane tank was leaking inside his
kitchen. You are told by the IC to attempt to remove the remaining gas with a ventilation fan.
Where should you position the fan?
A) In a window on the highest level of the residence.

ventilation fan on the floor will be more effective than positioning at higher levels.
384) You are called to a two story residence for a carbon monoxide call. The Captain hands
you the meter and tells you to meter the entire residence. Where would you expect to find the

Because of this fact the CO gas will rise to the highest level in the residence.
CO detectors should be placed at the highest level in the residence and always remember to
meter the second story, even if the source of the CO is in the basement.

A) The male side is made from a different alloy than the female side.
B) The male side displays a larger shank.
C) By noting the location of the Higbee cut.
D) By noting the presence of the rocker lugs or pins on the shank. Only male shanks have
rocker lugs or pins.
Answer --> D
Notes) Page 822, Essentials Of Fire Fighting And Fire Department Operations, 6th Edition.
Knowledge of this little fact could someday save your life. The shank on the female coupling is
smooth. It has no rocker lugs. The female swivel has lugs, but not the shank. Remember this. If
you are in total darkness, and disoriented, the hoseline can lead you out of a building.
Always feel for the presence of rocker lugs on the mail coupling. Follow the male coupling and
it will lead you out of the building.
Remember the male coupling is next to the hose. The smooth female coupling is also next to
the hose. The female swivel is on the opposite side of the female shank. So feel for the hose
and then move your hand until you feel the shank. If it is smooth it is the female end. If it has
rocker lugs, its the male. Follow the male.
1206) What is the main purpose of the "Higbee cut?"
A) Helps prevent cross-threading of the coupling.
